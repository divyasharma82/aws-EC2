# Lab 4: Creating a Linux Server in AWS and Connecting with PuTTY

In this lab, you will learn how to create a Linux server instance on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and connect to it using PuTTY and PuTTYgen on a Windows machine.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- PuTTY and PuTTYgen installed on your Windows machine.

## Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console

[Follow the steps mentioned in the previous lab.]

## Step 2: Launch a Linux Instance

[Follow the steps mentioned in the previous lab.]

## Step 3: Connect to Your Linux Server Using PuTTY and PuTTYgen

3.1. Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) and [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) if you haven't already.

3.2. Launch PuTTYgen and click on the "Load" button.

3.3. In the "Load Private Key" dialog, browse to and select the private key (.pem) file you downloaded when creating your EC2 instance.

3.4. Click "Open" to load the key. PuTTYgen may convert it to a different format (e.g., .ppk).

3.5. Click the "Save private key" button and save the private key with a .ppk extension (e.g., `your-key.ppk`).

3.6. Launch PuTTY.

3.7. In the "Session" category on the left, enter the public IP address or DNS name of your Linux instance in the "Host Name (or IP address)" field.

3.8. In the "Connection" category, expand the "SSH" section and click on "Auth."

3.9. In the "Private key file for authentication" field, browse and select the .ppk private key file you saved earlier.

3.10. Go back to the "Session" category, enter a name for your session in the "Saved Sessions" field, and click the "Save" button to save your session settings for future use.

3.11. Click the "Open" button to initiate the SSH connection.

3.12. PuTTY will prompt you for the username. For Amazon Linux and CentOS instances, use `ec2-user`. For Ubuntu instances, use `ubuntu`.

3.13. You are now connected to your Linux server using PuTTY and PuTTYgen on your Windows machine.

## Conclusion
You have successfully created a Linux server instance on AWS EC2 and connected to it using PuTTY and PuTTYgen on your Windows machine.
