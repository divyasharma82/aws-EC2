# Lab 2: Installing IIS Web Server and Creating Web Pages on Windows Server

In this lab, you will learn how to install and configure the Internet Information Services (IIS) web server on a Windows Server instance hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Additionally, you will create and host a simple webpage on your IIS server.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- An EC2 instance with Windows Server installed (follow Lab 1 instructions if you haven't set up an instance yet).
- AWS CLI installed and configured with access keys.

## Step 1: Install IIS (Internet Information Services)

1.1. Connect to your Windows Server instance using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

1.2. Open **Server Manager** (you can find it in the taskbar or search for it in the Start menu).

1.3. In Server Manager, click on **Manage** in the top-right corner and select **Add Roles and Features**.

1.4. Click **Next** until you reach the **Roles** section.

1.5. In the Roles section, select **Web Server (IIS)**.

1.6. Click **Next** through the rest of the wizard, then click **Install** to begin the IIS installation.

1.7. Wait for the installation to complete, and then click **Close**.

## Step 2: Create a Simple Web Page

2.1. Open **File Explorer** on your Windows Server.

2.2. Navigate to the following directory:


2.3. In the `wwwroot` directory, create a new folder for your website (e.g., `my-website`).

2.4. Inside the website folder, create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) using a text editor like Notepad.

2.5. Add some content to your `index.html` file. For example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My AWS EC2 Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website hosted on AWS EC2!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage created on my Windows Server.</p>
</body>
</html>
